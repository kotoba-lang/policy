(ns policy.execute
  "A pure decision engine for a policy-as-EDN model. Evaluates each rule's
  condition against a request (via IAttribute port) and combines applicable
  rules' effects by the policy's combining algorithm.

  `decide` returns {:policy/decision :allow|:deny|:not-applicable :policy/by rule-id-or-nil}.

  Algorithm semantics:
    :deny-overrides   — any applicable deny → deny (cite first deny rule);
                        else any applicable allow → allow; else :not-applicable.
    :allow-overrides  — any applicable allow → allow (cite first allow rule);
                        else any applicable deny → deny; else :not-applicable.
    :first-applicable — first applicable rule in declaration order wins;
                        else :not-applicable.

  Condition evaluation:
    leaf        {:policy/attr … :policy/op … :policy/value …} — resolve attr via IAttribute
                then apply op to :policy/value.
    :policy/and — all sub-conditions must hold (short-circuits on false).
    :policy/or  — at least one sub-condition must hold (short-circuits on true).
    :policy/not — negates the sub-condition.
    nil         — unconditional; rule is always applicable.

  Ops:
    :=  :!=  :<  :>  :<=  :>=  — equality / ordering on the resolved value
    :in       — resolved value is a member of :policy/value (a collection)
    :contains — resolved value (a collection) contains :policy/value

  RBAC helper: `permits?` checks whether a named role holds a permission string
  via :policy/roles, without touching IAttribute."
